<h1>The Best Movies According to Siva</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Alita Battle Angel</h3>
<p>It remains, for me, a mystery the source of seduction of this film. Sure, the story, the fights, the determination and vulnerability of the lead character.
    But it is more. Something becoming, scene by scene, the answer to deep expectations of the viewer. The story is simple and many pieces of it are so familiar.
    But it remains, from the beginning to the last scene, just fascinating. No explanations. Only a great and solid show.</p>
<h3>2. BattleShip</h3>
<p>What one has to remember when watching 'Battleship' is that it's based off a board game. I'm not sure what the expectation was for some people,
    but they literally took a board game and made it into a movie while promoting the crap out of the Navy. If you don't at least understand that,
    then why are you watching the movie at all?</p>
<h3>3. Lucy</h3>
<p>Lucy (2014) is written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla. Just like The Fifth Element this movie is very similar to that movie,
    just it has a different story and different cast of actors in it. At least unlike Taken 3 This film is well shot and bloody. I adore Scarlett and she is an absolute delight to see in this.
    I just finished watching Lucy today and I like it. It was really good descent sci-fi action flick.</p>
